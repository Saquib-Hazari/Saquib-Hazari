# 📊 Data Science Environment Setup with Python 🐍

## 🚀 Overview

This repository sets up a Python environment for Data Science and Machine Learning projects. The environment is managed using `conda`, and all required libraries are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. Below are the steps to create a Conda environment, install the dependencies, and push/pull your project to/from GitHub.

## 📂 Libraries Overview

### 🔢 Numerical Computing Libraries

- **numpy**: Efficient array operations for numerical data.
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis tool for handling tabular data.
- **scipy**: Scientific computing for advanced mathematical operations.

### 🧠 Machine Learning Libraries

- **scikit-learn**: Traditional machine learning models.
- **xgboost**: Gradient boosting framework.
- **lightgbm**: Optimized gradient boosting.
- **tensorflow**: Deep learning framework.
- **pytorch**: Open-source deep learning framework.

### 📊 Data Visualization Libraries

## 📝 Setup Guide

### 1. 💻 Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
```
````

### 2. 🌱 Create & Activate Conda Environment

Create a new Conda environment and activate it:

```bash
conda create --name mydatascienceenv python=3.8
conda activate mydatascienceenv
```

### 3. 📦 Install Dependencies

Install all the required libraries from `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 📤 Pushing to GitHub

After completing your project or changes, follow these steps to push it to GitHub.

### 1. Stage the files:

```bash
git add .
```

### 2. Commit the changes:

```bash
git commit -m "Add your commit message here"
```

### 3. Push to the repository:

```bash
git push origin main
```

---

## 📥 Pulling from GitHub

To pull the latest changes from the repository:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

---

## 📋 Managing Dependencies with `requirements.txt`

If you install new libraries, update the `requirements.txt` file by running the following command:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

To always install the latest version of libraries, you can manually modify `requirements.txt` like so:

```txt
numpy>=1.19.2
pandas>=1.1.3
scikit-learn>=0.24.1
# Add other libraries as required
```
